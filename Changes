Changes for PDL::Opt::QP

0.24 - Thu May 30 19:13:04 EDT 2013
    Pushes more of the allocation/deallocation work to PDL::PP. Should
    avoid some memory errors.

    Allows "stacked" optimization problems. Each input matrix/vector can
    have one additional dimension. The optimization will be done
    (independently) for each of the dimensions.

    Convert qp() to use key/value arguments for the equality and
    inequality constraints. Much cleaner.

    Thanks for run4flat++ for guiding me and rewriting much of my code to
    take advantage of PDL::PP.

0.21 - Thu May 16 15:37:23 EDT 2013
    Implements the new interface (split Aeq and Aneq) in qp

0.20 - Thu May 16 12:21:50 EDT 2013
    Converts to MB::Pluggable
    Rearranges and adds a second interface with separate Aeq and Aneq
    Still a work in progress (alpha)

0.01 - Mon May 13 14:18:34 EDT 2013
    Initial (test) release of PDL::Opt::QP
